# Project Proposal
The idea for this project is analyzing tourism density and its effects on cities. There is not one particular data set that has all the data that we are interested, so we had to curate and compile data from multiple sources into one database that had everything we wanted, following the ETL (extract, transform, load) procedural model.

## Data Sources (Extract):
City Population
Number of Tourists per City

## Cleaning and Aggregation (Transform):
Relational (connected by cities?)

## Compiled Data (Load):
